# About

If you've ever used Django or involved in web development, there is a very
high chance that you've met template engine.

# Syntax

Just like a subset of [jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/):

- `{{ value.attribute | filter | filter }}` for expressions.
- `{% ... %}` for statement.
- `{# ... #}` for comments.
